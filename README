								Pythran

What is it?
-----------

Pythran is a python to c++ compiler for a subset of the python language. It
takes a python module annotated with a few interface description and turns it
into a native python module with the same interface, but (hopefully) faster.

Installation
------------

	o Gather dependencies:

		$> PYTHONPATH=<my_prefix>/lib/python<my_version>/site-packages \
				easy_install --prefix=<my_prefix> codepy ply numpy networkx
		$> sudo apt-get install libboost-python-dev

	o Use the install target from setup script, in source driectory

		$> python setup.py install --prefix=<my_prefix>

	o Write your environment in stone
		
		$> export PYTHONPATH=<my_prefix>/lib/python<my_version>/site-packages
		$> export PATH=<my_prefix>/bin


Basic Usage
-----------

A simple pythran input could be

	<< dprod.py >>
	#pythran export dprod(int list, int list)
	def dprod(l0,l1):
		return sum([x*y for x,y in zip(l0,l1)])

To turn it into a native module, run

	$> pythran dprod.py

That will generate a native dprod.so that can be imported just like the former
module.

Documentation
----------

The CLI documentation is available from the pythran help command.

	$> pythran --help

The developper documentation is also available using pydoc, but is somehow
minimalistic.

	$> pydoc pythran
	$> pydoc pythran.typing
